**ECoPANN (Estimating Cosmological Parameters with Artificial Neural Network)**

ECoPANN is a new method to estimate cosmological parameters accurately based on ANN.

It is an alternative to the traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, 
and can obtain almost the same results as MCMC.

It is proposed by `Guo-Jian Wang, Si-Yao Li, Jun-Qing Xia (2020)
